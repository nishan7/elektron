MQTT & REST API for direct integration with our own energy monitoring platform.
Local Control via HTTP requests (no cloud dependency needed).
Integration with Home Automation Systems (Home Assistant, OpenHAB, Node-RED).


- Real-Time Dashboard – Display live power consumption using Grafana.
- Historical Data Analytics – Analyze power trends over days, weeks, or months.
- Custom Alerts & Notifications – Send alerts when power usage crosses a threshold (via email, SMS, Slack, or Webhooks).
- Multi-Device Monitoring – Track power usage across multiple smart plugs/smart meters in one place.
- Device Health Monitoring – Track device lifespan, voltage fluctuations, and overload risks.
- Anomaly Detection – Identify unusual spikes or abnormal consumption patterns using Machine Learning (e.g., TensorFlow, Scikit-learn).
- Energy Forecasting – Predict next week’s/month’s power usage based on historical trends.
- Smart Recommendations – Suggest power-saving tips (e.g., "Running AC at 22°C saves 10% energy").
- Dynamic Pricing Alerts – Notify users when electricity rates change based on utility provider tariffs.
- AI-Based Appliance Control – Learn usage patterns and automatically adjust device schedules.
